You can get Anomaly mod working through Steam (with all of Steam's funcionality) if you want
1.Delete everything in Call of Pripyat folder
2.Dump entire Anomaly content into CoP folder
3.Run AnomalyLauncher.exe once and start random game to make sure everything is working and you didnt loose any files while copying them
4.Exit out of the game
5.Rename AnomalyLauncher.exe into "Stalker-COP"
6.Rename DX version of Anomaly (it is inside bin folder) you want to use to "xrEngine"
7.Start the game through steam

You will have to mod the game manually without Mod Manager but it isnt a problem at all since pretty much 99% of addons 
require you to dump everything into "gamedata" folder.
