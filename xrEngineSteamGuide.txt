You can get Anomaly mod working through steam (with all of steam's funcionality) if you want
Delete everything in Call of Pripyat folder
Dump entire Anomaly content into CoP folder
Run AnomalyLauncher.exe once and start random game to make sure everything is working and you didnt loose any files while copying
Exit out of the game
Rename AnomalyLauncher.exe into "Stalker-COP"
Rename DX version of Anomaly (it is inside bin folder) you want to use to "xrEngine"
Start the game through steam

You will have to mod the game manually without Mod Manager but it isnt a problem at all since pretty much 99% of addons require you to dump everything into gamedata folder. I managed to have 20+ mods with no issues
